# HashMap
Implemented a hashmap using static arrays, dynamic arrays and linked lists. Includes collision handling through quadratic probing and separate chaining.
Functions of array, linked list, and hashmap were programmed with optimal time complexity. Written with well-documented, modular code using principles of object oriented programming.

HashMap_SC implemented through Separate Chaining

HashMap_OA implemented through Open Addressing
